# Module 3: Using your on-premises StorageZone



## Shared Folder

With ShareFile it is possible to leverage more than a single StorageZone on an account, allowing customers to store their data in multiple on-prem zones, cloud zones, Citrix-managed zones or some combination thereof. 

To assign your newly created StorageZone to a Shared Folder first log into your ShareFile account, then navigate to _Folders > Shared Folders_. Click the green circle at the top right of the page and select **Create Folder**.

In the dialogue, name your folder and then select your private zone from the *StorageZone dropdown menu*.

Once in your folder drag to upload a file or two.
